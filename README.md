The data used for analysis are FINAL_VALUE and FINAL_POSITION_VALUE.
The error judgment is considered from the following perspectives.
1. The magnitude of the error
2. The duration of the error above a certain level
3. If it occurs continuously
The Objective is
1)Perform Trend Analysis on Final_value and Final_Position_Value
2)Create an Algorithm to make the Final_value and Final_Position_Value same or make the error zero
